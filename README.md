# Warp-Development-
My Warp Development Assessment 

1. Warp Develop QA test file contains all my answers to the theory questions

2. Warp-Test-Cases .csv file contains my answer to 2.2.1 ) "Write a series of test cases that cover"

3. Log.py python file contains my answer to 2.1.1 ) Write a function

4. sample_log is the sample log file

N.B I built a function that is be able to extract the information from a given log file, then once I have that information I can analyse and extract the information I want e.g. if I want to see all log lines that occurred with level "Error" "INFO", "WARNING". I decoupled it and made it so that one can filter by time and date and message as well.

Futhermore, it was more efficient to build a class and decouple some components. Lastly, this can be improved by filtering through automation specific log lines and grouping them. e.g. in this log file we have 10 entries that listed an event as Error, etc.
